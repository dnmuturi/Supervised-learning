Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction (Machine Learning)
Project Overview

Hotel booking cancellations and no-shows significantly reduce revenue, particularly for last-minute bookings. This project applies machine learning to predict the likelihood of a booking being canceled before the arrival date.

Using real-world data from INN Hotels Group (Portugal), the project uncovers key drivers of cancellations and delivers a predictive model to support smarter pricing, overbooking, and refund policies.

Business Problem

High cancellation rates impact hotels through:

Lost revenue from unsold rooms

Increased distribution and commission costs

Last-minute price reductions that shrink margins

Operational overhead for managing booking changes

The challenge is to proactively identify high-risk bookings and act before revenue is lost.

Project Objectives

Analyze historical booking data to identify cancellation patterns

Engineer features that capture customer behavior and booking risk

Build and evaluate machine learning models for cancellation prediction

Translate model insights into actionable business recommendations

Dataset

The dataset consists of historical hotel booking records, including:

Lead time, stay duration, and booking dates

Customer and market segment information

Distribution channel and deposit type

Pricing variables and special requests

Booking outcome (canceled vs. not canceled)

Technical Approach

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and risk factors

Feature engineering and selection

Model training, tuning, and evaluation

Interpretation of results using business-focused metrics
