Project Overview

Hotel booking cancellations and no-shows cause significant revenue loss, especially for last-minute bookings. This project applies machine learning to predict the likelihood of a booking being canceled.

Using data from INN Hotels Group (Portugal), the project analyzes key factors influencing cancellations, builds predictive models, and provides insights to support data-driven cancellation and refund policies that improve profitability.

Objectives

Identify key factors influencing hotel booking cancellations

Build a machine learning model to predict cancellation risk

Enable proactive decision-making for pricing, overbooking, and refund policies

Reduce revenue loss caused by last-minute cancellations and no-shows

Dataset

The dataset contains historical hotel booking records, including:

Booking and stay details

Customer and channel characteristics

Pricing, lead time, and deposit information

Booking status (canceled or not canceled)

Approach

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis to identify cancellation patterns

Feature engineering and selection

Model training and evaluation

Interpretation of results and business insights

Expected Outcomes

A predictive model that identifies high-risk cancellations in advance

Insights into behavioral and booking-related drivers of cancellations

Recommendations for more effective cancellation and refund policies
